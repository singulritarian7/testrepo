GitHub Overview
First, let us introduce to GitHub. GitHub in simple words is a collection of folders and files. It is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command-line tool and a server needs to be hosted and maintained via command line as well, GitHub provides this Git server for you and a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as wikis and basic task management tools for every project. GitHub provides cloud storage for source code, supports all popular programming languages, and streamlines the iteration process. GitHub includes a free plan for individual developers and for hosting open source projects.
